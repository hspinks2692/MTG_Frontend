# MTG_Frontend
In this project, I'll be attempting to build a comprehensive Magic the Gathering site. This will have several components to it: searching, deck building, and many other aspects that can be found under the hood. Overall, this can be a very challenging and also a very useful project. Since a lot of my friends play the game, I can ̶u̶s̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶m̶ ̶a̶s̶ ̶l̶a̶b̶ ̶r̶a̶t̶s̶ ask for their assistance in testing my site.

Overall I have a basic idea of how I want my site to look.

This would be the idea for my home page. Later down the line I might find a way to use bootstrap in this but for now this is a very basic layout of my home page.

In terms of site flow:

It may seem a little complex but it is understandable. 

For the boilerplate, I used a previous lab we had gone over here:

This was a great help for getting started and gave me a definitive point to get everything going!

I have a full plan on where I want to go and how I will tackle this. I'm looking forward to finishing this project!
