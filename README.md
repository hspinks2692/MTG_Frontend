# MTG_Frontend
In this project, I'll be attempting to build a comprehensive Magic the Gathering site. This will have several components to it: searching, deck building, and many other aspects that can be found under the hood. Overall, this can be a very challenging and also a very useful project. Since a lot of my friends play the game, I can ̶u̷s̷e̷ ̷t̷h̷e̷m̷ ̷a̷s̷ ̷l̷a̷b̷ ̷r̷a̷t̷s̷  ask for their assistance in testing my site.

Overall I have a basic idea of how I want my site to look.

This would be the idea for my home page. Later down the line I might find a way to use bootstrap in this but for now this is a very basic layout of my home page. In terms of site flow:

It may seem a little complex but it is understandable. For the boilerplate, I used a previous lab we had gone over here:

This was a great help for getting started and gave me a definitive point to get everything going!

For the display page, the way I intend to work on using an image to show the card, then clicking on it brings up more details. It might look something along these lines:

The API will allow me to pull the card image, by making that image clickable, it can take to that specific card's show page using its ID as the link addition. After that, it's just using a series of calls to pull from that one card's details. Aside from this, I'd be using the API to manage my searching whereas I'll be telling it where and when to search.

I have a full plan on where I want to go and how I will tackle this. I'm looking forward to finishing this project!
